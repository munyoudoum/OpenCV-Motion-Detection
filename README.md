# OpenCV Motion Detection
* It is also possible to use realtime video by IP address to detect the motion, so it can also be used as a smart camera
* When there is motion detected in the frame, it will send a message on Facebook
* Login Facebook on python using FBChat is **not recommended** since it is not an official module from Facebook
